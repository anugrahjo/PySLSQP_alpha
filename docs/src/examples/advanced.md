# Advanced examples

These pages for each category of examples are optional 
and are required only if you plan to classify your examples
into different classes such as basic, intermediate, advanced, etc.
or any other classification suitable for your package.
If no classification is required, just remove these pages
and add the example files directly into the toctree of the main
examples page.
