# List of all dependencies required to host the documentation on Read the Docs
# Read the Docs uses container-based builds, and by default, these containers don't have gfortran installed. 
# Therefore, defining a conda environment is necessary, pip cannot handle gfortran installation.
# conda can slow down our Read the Docs builds, because conda environments take longer to create than virtualenv environments. 
# However, this is currently the best way to install gfortran on Read the Docs.
